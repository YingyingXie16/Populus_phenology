# Introduction
This repository comprises R codes and data for the research project: 'Sex-dependent phenological responses to climate vary across
speciesâ€™ ranges' published on PNAS in 2023.

# R code and data
R script includes LME modeling and future prediction of Populus species flowering phenology among species, sex and ecoregions, and between first flower and first leaf out phenophases among species. Datasets include phenology data obtained and processed from Herbarium specimens and National Phenology Network with climate data obtained from CHELSA and ClimateNA.
